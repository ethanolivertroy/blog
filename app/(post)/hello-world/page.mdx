# Hello World

This is my first blog post. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## Getting Started

I built this blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and MDX. The design is inspired by [rauchg's blog](https://rauch.io).

Here's what I'm excited about:

- Writing in markdown with the power of React components
- Fast builds and great developer experience
- Clean, minimal design that focuses on content

## What's Next

I'll be writing about software development, technology, and whatever else catches my interest. Stay tuned.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Thanks for stopping by.
